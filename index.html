                <p>She is the beautiful, brave and strong daughter of the aliʻi (chief) of Motunui. 
                Her father has enforced a rule since the beginning of his reign,
                forbidding any of his subjects to venture past the ocean reef. Despite her father's strict ruling, Moana feels
                inexplicably drawn to the ocean. The island of Motunui is slowly decaying and soon there will be no food, causing Moana to attempt to take a canoe past the reef to help her people find food.
                She fails and wrecks the canoe, nearly drowning and wounding herself in the process.</p>

            <p>Moana's mischievous and beloved grandmother, Tala, encourages her to follow her heart and venture out again. She shows Moana the history of her people as voyagers of the sea and
                tells her of how the demigod Maui stole The Heart of the goddess Te Fiti, causing darkness to spread across the lands and all wildlife to slowly drain away. Grandma Tala also
                bestows upon Moana a magical stone, The Heart of Te Fiti. She shows her that the ocean has chosen her
                as the hero who will restore Te Fiti's heart and save their home from disaster. Moana leaves Motunui, alone, but completely determined to fulfill her destiny.

            <h3>Maui: &quot;shapeshifter, hero to all, demigod of the wind and sea&quot;</h3>
            <img src ="https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/maui_0-1.jpg?w=612" alt = "Maui: shapeshifter, hero to all, demigod of the wind and sea" style="width:800px;height:500px;">
            <p>Early in her voyage, her ship wrecks during a storm and the ocean helps her find the island that the demigod Maui was stranded on for 1000 years. They have a rocky relationship in the beginning, but they soon become very good friends and Maui even teaches Moana to sail and navigate the sea. 
                They fight off the Kakamora, a large band of pirates who try to steal the Heart of Te Fiti. They also venture into Lalotai: The Realm of Monsters to find Tamatoa, a giant crab that dons Maui's magical hook as decoration. Together, they defeat Tamatoa and retrieve Maui's magical hook that gives him the power to shapeshift.

                <h3>Te Ka, angry lava goddess guarding the resting place of Te Fiti</h3>

            <p>With Maui's powers intact, the pair make their way to find Te Fiti and return her heart. As they approach the resting place of Te Fiti they encounter Te Ka, an angry lava goddess. Te Ka attacks their canoe and Maui tries to fight her with his hook. Te Ka proves to be more than a formidable foe as she easily breaks Maui's hook with
                her lava attacks and causes Moana's canoe to be broken and pushed far away from the barrier islands that Te Ka resides in. Maui doubts himself and his power to fight and leaves Moana to continue alone. She begins to doubt herself and tells the ocean that it made a mistake in choosing her to be the hero.

            <p>Grandma Tala visits Moana and encourages her to remember who she , who her people are and where she came from. Reinvigorated, Moana repairs her canoe and sails back toward the barrier islands where Te Ka dwells. As she is beginning her attempt to get past Te Ka, Maui comes back to help her. Working together as a team once again, 
                Maui manages to get Moana past Te Ka to where Te Fiti lies but his hook breaks in the process. However, Moana finds that Te Fiti is gone. She looks back at the angry Te Ka and realizes something. She raises Te Fiti's heart for Te Ka to see but she is stuck on the barrier islands. Moana tells the ocean to let the goddess come to her. The ocean parts and Te Ka races 
                toward Moana in a fiery rage. Moana sings a song of hope and acknowledges that she sees the pain Te Ka endures and the anger that pain has caused, but Moana recognizes who Te Ka truly is. </p>

            <p>They come together, between the parted ocean and share a honi (traditional greeting touching together at the forehead and nose and exchanging breath). This display of love and understanding brings Te Ka to trust Moana and she allows her to do what the ocean chose her to do. Moana places the Heart of Te Fiti in Te Ka's chest, transforming Te Ka back into the beautiful 
                goddess of life and nature, Te Fiti.</p>

            <p>She thanks Moana for her kindness and bravery and forgives Maui for his crime against her. Te Fiti blesses Moana and fixes her boat, as well as Maui's hook. Then she restores life to the land and sea and returns to her peaceful slumber. Maui and Moana return to Motunui to find the people in happiness and health, with the land and sea restored to their full glory.</p>

            <p>As Moana becomes the new chief, she leads her people to voyage the sea once again in search of new land and new memories to be made. Grandma Tala can be seen in her stingray form swimming next to Moana's canoe, blessing her travels. Maui travels with them as well, shapeshifting as he pleases and watching over his friend as they sail into new adventures.</p>
